## Building Locally
In addition to the NuGet packages in the solution file, this project also relies on
[miniLZO](https://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/). Download it, and extract all files into the
`minilzo` folder from this project. The solution has already been set up to read and build the
source files from there.
