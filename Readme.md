# Borderlands Advanced Gadget to Permit Interesting Profile Edits
Totally not a forced acronym.

Profile editor for Borderlands 1, 2, TPS, and BL1 Enhanced. On top of the standard edits, also
allows editing in the raw data format all four games use.

### Building Locally
In addition to the NuGet packages in the solution file, this project also relies on
[miniLZO](https://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/). Download this, and extract all files into the
`minilzo` folder from this project. The solution has already been set up to read and build the
source files from there.
